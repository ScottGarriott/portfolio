       <h2>Yo! Sup...I'm Scott!</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Scott Garriott. I have lived in Oakland, California, my entire life and honestly at this point I'll probably never leave. I have recently started my journey of learning at Thinkful. It is intimidating for me but I am still excited. </p>

      <div class="about-me">
        <h3>Welcome to my webpage!</h3>
        <p>I have a keen eye for detail and I love learning new things. I am a great team player, one has to be if they want to DM.  In my spare time I play table top role playing games. It is a great way to collaborate with your friends and make an interesting and compelling story at the same time.  It gives me a performative outlet, which I was missing after I stopped acting after high school.</p>

        <p>Here are a few ways I think being a dungeon master can help me with my web design career: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It has prepared me to think on my feet. Being a DM is all about being adaptable, players always do what you are not expecting.</li>
          <li>It has helped me learn to manage a group of people so everyone gets thier ideas heard.</li>
          <li>Having started our game during the pandemic I have gotten alot better with general file organization. You gotta have all the characters and locations easily accessable!</li>
        </ul>
